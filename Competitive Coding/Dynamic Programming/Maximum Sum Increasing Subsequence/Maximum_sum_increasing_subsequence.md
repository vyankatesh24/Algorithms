Maximum Sum in an increasing subsequence - Dynamic Programming

-This algorithm is a slight variation in the Longest Increasing Subsequence.
-In this algorithm we insert a case to check whether the sum of the new increasing subsequence is greater than the previous one or not.

Example:-

arr[] = {2,3,100,5,6,101,1}

Now, here the maximum sum increasing subsequence will be = 206.
