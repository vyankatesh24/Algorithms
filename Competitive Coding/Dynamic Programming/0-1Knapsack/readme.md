# 0-1 Knapsack
The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items.

**Time Complexity**
Time Complexity: O(nW) where n is the number of items and W is the capacity of knapsack.
### Applications
Knapsack problems appear in real-world decision-making processes in a wide variety of fields, such as finding the least wasteful way to cut raw materials,[4] selection of investments and portfolios selection of assets for asset-backed securitization and generating keys for the Merkleâ€“Hellman and other knapsack cryptosystems
