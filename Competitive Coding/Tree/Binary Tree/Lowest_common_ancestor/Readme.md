# Lowest Common Ancestor

This fig shows some examples of the lowest common ancestor of two nodes:

# Idea behind LCA

The idea is to traverse the tree starting from root. If any of the given keys (n1 and n2) matches with root, then root is LCA (assuming that both keys are present). If root doesnâ€™t match with any of the keys, we recur for left and right subtree. The node which has one key present in its left subtree and the other key present in right subtree is the LCA. If both keys lie in left subtree, then left subtree has LCA also, otherwise LCA lies in right subtree.

# Time Complexity

Time complexity of the above solution is O(n) as the method does a simple tree traversal in bottom up fashion.

Note that the above method assumes that keys are present in Binary Tree. If one key is present and other is absent, then it returns the present key as LCA (Ideally should have returned NULL).

We can extend this method to handle all cases by passing two boolean variables v1 and v2. v1 is set as true when n1 is present in tree and v2 is set as true if n2 is present in tree.
